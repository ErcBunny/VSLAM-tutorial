# CH2: Rigid Body Motion

## Rotation Matrix

1. Bases & coordinates
2. Dot product & hat operator
3. Special orthogonal group
4. Transform matrix & homogeneous representation
   1. Special euclidean group
   2. Viewed from "configuration" perspective
      1. Transform matrix itself can represent the configuration of an object frame, relative to world frame
      2. R is made up of column vectors of the object frame
      3. P is the position of the origin of the object frame
      4. It is a convention to think of rigid body motion as the motion of an attached object frame
      5. In this case, denote world frame as 1 and object frame 2, then $g_{12}$ is the configuration of object frame
   3. Viewed from coordinates transformation perspective
      1. Based on the idea of attaching an object frame to the object that we want to track
      2. $q_{world}=g_{world,object}q_{object}$, where $q_{object}$ is the homogeneous coordinates of a point relative to object frame, and this equation answers how to calculate the coordinates of that point in world frame
      3. $g_{12}$ means a tranformation from 2 to 1
5. Eigen Library
   1. Eigen is a special library built with pure header files
   2. When you use it, you only need to import Eigenâ€™s header file
   3. In CMakeLists.txt, the only requirement is `include_directories("/usr/include/eigen3")`

## Rotation Vector & Euler Angle

1. For describing a rotation in a more compact form
2. Rotation vector is the unit vector along the rotation axis, and with the amount of angle, we can fully define a rotation motion
   * Rodrigues' formular
   * See robotics notes for the conversion between matrices and vector + angle
3. Details about euler angle is written in robotics notes, nothing interesting
   * In theory, it can be proved that as long as you want to use three real numbers to express the three-dimensional rotation, you will inevitably encounter the singularity problem
   * Euler angles are not suitable for interpolation or iterations, and are often only used in human-computer interaction
