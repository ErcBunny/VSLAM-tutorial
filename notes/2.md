# CH2: Rigid Body Motion

## Rotation Matrix

1. Bases & coordinates
2. Dot product & hat operator
3. Special orthogonal group
4. Transform matrix & homogeneous representation
   1. Viewed from "configuration" perspective
      1. Transform matrix itself can represent the configuration of an object frame, relative to world frame
      2. R is made up of column vectors of the object frame
      3. P is the position of the origin of the object frame
      4. It is a convention to think of rigid body motion as the motion of an attached object frame
      5. In this case, denote world frame as 1 and object frame 2, then $g_{12}$ is the configuration of object frame
   2. Viewed from coordinates transformation perspective
      1. Based on the idea of attaching an object frame to the object that we want to track
      2. $q_{world}=g_{world,object}q_{object}$, where $q_{object}$ is the homogeneous coordinates of a point relative to object frame, and this equation answers how to calculate the coordinates of that point in world frame
