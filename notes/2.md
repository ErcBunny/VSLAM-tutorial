# CH2: Rigid Body Motion

## Rotation Matrix

1. Bases & coordinates
2. Dot product & hat operator
3. Special orthogonal group
4. Transform matrix & homogeneous representation
   1. Special euclidean group
   2. Viewed from "configuration" perspective
      1. Transform matrix itself can represent the configuration of an object frame, relative to world frame
      2. R is made up of column vectors of the object frame
      3. P is the position of the origin of the object frame
      4. It is a convention to think of rigid body motion as the motion of an attached object frame
      5. In this case, denote world frame as 1 and object frame 2, then $g_{12}$ is the configuration of object frame
   3. Viewed from coordinates transformation perspective
      1. Based on the idea of attaching an object frame to the object that we want to track
      2. $q_{world}=g_{world,object}q_{object}$, where $q_{object}$ is the homogeneous coordinates of a point relative to object frame, and this equation answers how to calculate the coordinates of that point in world frame
      3. $g_{12}$ means a tranformation from 2 to 1
5. Eigen Library
   1. `sudo apt−get install libeigen3−dev`
   2. Eigen is a special library built with pure header files
   3. When you use it, you only need to import Eigen’s header file
   4. In CMakeLists.txt, the only requirement is `include_directories("/usr/include/eigen3")`

## Rotation Vector & Euler Angle

1. For describing a rotation in a more compact form
2. Rotation vector is the unit vector along the rotation axis, and with the amount of angle, we can fully define a rotation motion
   * Rodrigues' formula
   * See robotics notes for the conversion between matrices and vector + angle
3. Details about Euler angle is written in robotics notes, nothing interesting
   * Euler angles are not suitable for interpolation or iterations, and are often only used in human-computer interaction
4. In theory, it can be proved that as long as you want to use three real numbers to express the three-dimensional rotation, you will inevitably encounter the singularity problem
   * So both rotation vector and Euler angle representation suffer from singularity problem
   * The rotation vector also has a singularity, which occurs when the angle $\theta$ exceeds $2\pi$

## Quaternion

1. Abstract
   1. Similar to how a complex number can cause rotation in 2D space
   2. Quaternions are extended complex numbers found by Hamilton
   3. It is both compact and not singular
2. Definition
   1. $\bold{q}=q_0+q_1i+q_2j+q_3k$
   2. $\left\{\begin{aligned}i^2=j^2=k^2=-1\\ij=k,ji=-k\\jk=i,kj=-i\\ki=j,ik=-j\end{aligned}\right.$ 
   3. often written as $\bold{q}=[q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4]^T=[s,\bold{v}]^T$
3. Matrix representation: see 2.4.3 and equation (2.34)
   1. quaternion itself is an 4 by 1 matrix
   2. $\bold{q}^+$ and $\bold{q}^{\oplus}$
4. Operation
   1. $+/-$ and scalar $\times$: linear
   2. $\times$: linear distribution
      * $\bold{q_a}\bold{q_b}=[s_as_b-\bold{v}_a^T\bold{v}_b,s_a\bold{v}_b+s_b\bold{v}_a+\bold{v}_a\bold{v}_b]^T$
      * preserves length
      * can written in matrix form: $\bold{q_a}\bold{q_b}=\bold{q}_a^{+}\bold{q}_b=\bold{q}_b^{\oplus}\bold{q}_a$
   3. Absolute value: the same as other complex numbers
   4. Conjugate: take the imaginary part as the opposite
      * $q^*q=qq^*=[s^2+\bold{v}^T\bold{v},\bold{0}]^T$
   5. Inverse: $q^{-1}=\frac{q^*}{\abs{q}^2}$
      * $(\bold{q}_a\bold{q}_b)^{-1}=\bold{q}_b^{-1}\bold{q}_a^{-1}$
5. Rotation
   1. The quaternion that represents a point $\bold{p}$:
      * put the three coordinates of a point into the imaginary part and leave the real part to be zero
   2. The quaternion that represents a roatation $\bold{q}$:
      * the rotated point in quaternion representation is $\bold{p}'=\bold{q}\bold{p}\bold{q}^{-1}=\bold{q}^+\bold{p}^+\bold{q}^{-1}=\bold{q}^+(\bold{q}^{-1})^\oplus\bold{p}$
   3. $\bold{p}'=\bold{q}^+(\bold{q}^{-1})^\oplus\bold{p}=diag(1,\bold{R})\bold{p}$
      * expand the upper equation in matrix form and we get the conversion from quaternion to rotation matrix
      * equation (2.39)
   4. Use trace calculation to get conversion from quaternion to axis and angle: equation (2.44)

## Other Transformations

1. In addition to the Euclidean transformation, there are several other transformations in the 3D space, where the Euclidean is the simplest. Some of them are related to camera geometry
2. The other transformations will change their shape, and they all have similar matrix representations
3. See table 2-1
