# Answers to Exercises in CH3

## 1. Verify that the rotation matrix is an orthogonal matrix.

1. Rotation matrices are in SO(3) so they are orthogonal matrices
2. To verify this fact, just calculate $RR^T$

## 2. Prove the Rodrigues' formula.

1. write rotation matrix as matrix exponential
2. expand $e^{\hat{\omega}\theta}$ as Taylor series and combine terms to get expanded form of cosine and sine

## 3. Verify that after the quaternion rotates a point, the result is a imaginary
quaternion (the real part is zero), so it still corresponds to a three-dimensional
space point.

1. write the rotation in matrix form and simply do matrix calculation
2. see 2.37

## 4. Draw a table that summarizes the conversion relationship of the rotation matrix, rotation angle, Euler angle and quaternion.

1. $R$-$\omega$&$\theta$: trace calculation, see robotics notes
2. $R$-RPY: see robotics notes
3. $R$-$q$: see equation 2.39
4. $\omega$&$\theta$-RPY: matrix exponential, see robotics notes
5. $\omega$&$\theta$-$q$: see equation 2.44
6. RPY-$q$: use rotation matrix as the bridge

## 5. Suppose there is a large Eigen matrix, we want to know the value in the top left 3 × 3 blocks, and then assign it to I 3×3 . Please implement it in C++.

```c++
Matrix<double, 100, 100> matrix_large = MatrixXd::Random(100, 100);
Matrix<double, 3, 3> matrix_small = Matrix3d::Zero();
cout << "matrix_small initial value = \n" << matrix_small << endl;
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
  for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++){
    matrix_small(i, j) = matrix_large(i, j);
  }
}
cout << "matrix_small processed value = \n" << matrix_small << endl;
```

## 6. When does a general linear equation Ax = b has a unique solution of x? How to solve it numerically? Can you implement it in Eigen?

1. When the number of unknowns equals to rank(A) or when A is invertible

2. Use the inverse of A: slow

3. Use QR decomposition: fast

4. Cholesky decomposition: even faster, only for positive-definite matrices

5. Implementation can be found in `ch3/useEigen/eigenMatrix.cpp`
