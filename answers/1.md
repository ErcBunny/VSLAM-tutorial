# Answers to Exercises in CH1

## 1. Suppose we have a linear equation Ax = b. If A and b are known, how to solve the x? What are the requirements for A and b if we want a unique x?

   1. Solutions exist when the rank of A equals to the rank of [A, b]. The unique solution exists when the rank of A equals to the number of the unknowns, otherwise there are infinite number of solutions which can be described as the combination of the unique solution and the nullspace of matrix A.

   2. Calculations could be done by hand reducing A to its RREF or with the following matlab code.

      ```matlab
      A=[1,1,4,0,0,5;1,0,1,2,0,0;0,1,0,1,1,0]
      b=[1;2;3]
      if(rank(A) == rank([A,b]))
          RREF=rref([A,b])
          homogeneous_solution=null(A,r)
          particular_solution=[RREF(:,end);zeros(size(A,2) - rank(A), 1)]
      else
          fprintf(no existing solution\n)
      end
      ```

   3. About using inverse and pseudo-inverse

      1. If A is invertible, then the unique solution is inv(A)b.
      2. If A is not invertible and the number of rows is larger, then
         * Ax = b is a least squares problem
         * pinv(A) = inv(A'A)A'
         * x = pinv(A)b
      3. If A is not invertible and the number of columns is larger, then
         * pinv(A) = A'inv(AA')
         * while x = pinv(A)b is the least norm optimal solution

## 2. What is a Gaussian distribution? What does it look like in a one-dimensional case? How about in a high-dimensional case?

1. Gaussian distribution is a description of a set of data whose characteristics can be determined by the mean and variance.

2. 1-D case can be depicted by its simplest probability density function:

   ![{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00cb9b2c9b866378626bcfa45c86a6de2f2b2e40)

3. In general H-D cases the mean becomes the mean matrix and variance becomes the covariance matrix. For details refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution.

## 3. Do you know the C++11 standard? Which new features have you heard of or used? Are you familiar with any other standard?

1. As far as I know, `auto` and `bind` are newly introduced features in C++11. And `bind` is extremly useful when creating callback functions.
2. C++98, C++11, C++20. I'm a C++11 user and I'm willing to embrace newer standards as they may bring exciting features to simplify my code.

## 4. What is the directory structure of Linux? What basic commands do you know?

1. For directory explanation, refer to this site: https://www.howtogeek.com/117435/htg-explains-the-linux-directory-structure-explained/.
2. RTFD.

## 5. Something about Ubuntu

1. Software installation: `sudo apt install <package name>`
2. Installation path: `dpkg -l`, `dpkg -l <package name>`
3. Search: `apt search <keyword>`

## 6. VIM tour?

* I use vscode, gedit and nano LOL.
